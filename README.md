# Digital-Discus-Throw
This Repository present motion 
detecting system. Embedded in a discus which has the same size 
and weight as a standard one used by male athletes, it can detect 
and record the motion data for the entire throwing processing to 
provide comprehensive throwing information for athletes and 
coaches. Called a digital discus, the overall system consists of 
embedded sensors, a discus, a wireless transmission and an upper 
PC. The sensor unit, including a 3D accelerometer and 3D digital 
gyroscopes, can acquire the three dimensional acceleration and 
angular rate of the discus in the entire discus-throwing duration. 
The wavelet transformation based motion detection algorithm is 
given. The system has been validated in field experiment showing 
its feasibility and effectiveness.
